				<h3>About</h3>

				<p>Hi, I&#39;m Timothy Mwiti.</p>

				<p>I am a rising junior at Northwestern University. I major in Computer Science. My career goal is to eventually start my own software development company in my home country, Kenya.</p>
				<p>When not drowned in school work, I work as a research assistant/software developer at Assistant Professor Marcelo Worsley's TIILT Lab. Our research is centered around using multimodal
				technology to understand and improve on how students learn in complex environments.</p>

				<p>Some of my hobbies include cycling, photography, reading and playing video games. Main interests include entrepreneurship and tech. I am a lover of sports. I enjoy watching
				soccer (Manchester United fan) as well as the NBA and College Football. I'll have a good time watching any kind of sport.</p>

				<p>Over time I have learnt that one of the most effective way to grow is to talk to people and hear their views. Therefore, I enjoy meeting new people and networking. Feel free to reach out through
				the means on the<a href ="http://timkanake.com/contact.html"> contact</a> page or through my social media below.</p>

				<p>Here&#39s my latest <a href="timothymwiti.pdf">resume</a>.</p>
